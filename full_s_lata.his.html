<b>Lata Mangeshkar</b>, <i>(born <u>September 28, 1929</u>, Indore, British India—died <u>February 6, 2022,</u> Mumbai, India),</i>
legendary Indian playback singer noted for her distinctive voice and a vocal range that extended over
more than three octaves. Her career spanned eight decades, and she recorded songs for the soundtracks 
of more than 2,000 Indian films.</p>

<b>
Mangeshkar’s father</b>, Dinanath Mangeshkar, was a noted Marathi stage personality popularly known 
as Master Dinanath. Lata, who was the eldest of five siblings, was introduced to music at an early age. 
She recorded her first song at age 13 for Vasant Joglekar’s Marathi film Kiti Hasaal, 
though her song did not make the final edit. Mangeshkar was trained from age five by her father, 
a disciple of the Gwalior gharana (a community of performers who share a distinctive musical style), 
and she was also tutored by maestros such as Aman Ali Khan Sahib and Amanat Khan. As a teenager, she struggled 
to help support her family and to establish herself as a playback singer in the Hindi film industry of the 1940s, 
at a time when the profession was dominated by such divas as Shamshad Begum and Noor Jehan.</p></div>
